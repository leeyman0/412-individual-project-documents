* Automata Football
  1. Good evening!
  2. Hello, I am Stanley and this is my project, /automata football/.
  3. What is /Automata Football/?
     1. A simple quick online game based around Conway's Game of Life
	1. Conway is an important mathematician, he devised this 
	2. It isn't really a game
	3. Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton
	   1. What is a cellular automaton
	      1. Similar to a turing machine or lambda calculus, as it can compute things
	      2. The computation is turning the cells on or off
	   2. An infinite grid of squares
	      1. squares (or cells) can either be on or off
	   3. Square rules:
	      1. If a cell has more than three neighbors lit up, it is off next turn
	      2. If a cell has less than 2 neighbors lit up, it is off next turn
	      3. If a cell has exactly 3 neighbors lit up, it is on next turn
	      4. If a cell has exactly 2 neighbors lit up and it is on, then it stays on next turn
	   4. People can make complex structures with this automaton
     2. The goal is simple:
	1. Engineer automata by clicking on the cells
	2. Reach the opponent's end zone --- Touchdown
	3. Secure your own end zone
	4. Every square that gets lit up in the opponent's endzone is a point for you
	5. Four turns
	6. Most points wins
     3. Even though the goal is simple, the strategies have the capacity to be complex
	1. Strategies stem from ambiguity
	   1. Can't see the opponent's side of the screen
	   2. Automata function
	2. Many different outcomes based on placement and and structure
  4. Demonstration time
     1. Technical Details while demonstration is going
	1. Server written as a node.js webapp
	2. Backend can run on Heroku
	3. Client written in ES6 JS (2015)
	   1. Practically everything is based on JS, CSS, and HTML
	4. Utilizes WebSockets for communication between the server and client
	5. Uses interactive SVGs for graphics
  5. Incomplete features
     1. Practice mode --- play automata football by yourself, Conway's game of life
	1. I can probably do it, I just need more time
     2. Time limits to turns --- speed things up a bit
	1. Requires a bit of communication through web sockets, and some computers are slower than others.
     3. Canvas client --- Just in case the SVG doesn't support some systems
