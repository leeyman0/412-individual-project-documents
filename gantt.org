* And here's where I would put a GANNT chart\dots if I had one
- I couldn't find the tools I needed to make a GANNT chart in time
- More seriously, here is the plan
  - Front-end functionality: Apr 28 - 29
    - Get log-in page
    - Get game page to function
    - Get practice mode page to function
  - Back-end functionality: Apr 30 - May 1
    - Design the message encoding system
    - Reuse the code that I have for this
  - Registration: May 2
    - Register and deploy my website
