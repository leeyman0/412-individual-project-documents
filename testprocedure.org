* Testing Requirements
  - Two players on computers
  - An empty test server loaded with the game ~Automata Football~
  - A /secure/ and /certain/ internet connection for both players
    - It shouldn't matter the browser they are in 
* The Test Procedure
  - The players connect to the URL of the empty test server
    - The players enter in any non-taken names
      - If they have been taken, try again with a different name
      - Repeat until they have been submitted successfully
  - The players are in the lobby
    - They assert that they are matched together
  - The players play against each other
    - The players build gliders on their own sides of the court
      - Any other game of life terms are fine too, we are checking to make sure that game of life works
    - The players submit their turns to the server, they should get feedback in the console of their browser that
      the information has been sent
      - We are now checking to see whether the server recieves information
    - The players now see their side and the other side simulated for ~20 secs
      - The players see if the mechanics are right
    - The players compare the state of the game screen to see if they are the reverse
      - We are checking to see if the game is the same for everyone, regardless of where or how they connect from
  - One of the players disconnects
    - They hit the \times on the browser tab
      - The browser tab closes
	- We are checking to see if disconnection is handled correctly
    - The other player receives a message that the other player has disconnected
    - The other player is victorious
    - The other player enters the lobby by hitting the "continue" button on the
  - The player who has disconnected reconnects
    - They enter in their name
    - They match with the other player
  - The players play one complete game
    - We must assert that:
      - The game has four rounds
      - The game has the same mechanics as the Game of Life
      - The game keeps score correctly
      - The person who wins gets the victory screen
      - The person who loses gets the defeat screen
  - The players enter another game
    - One of the players turns their wifi off
      - We are testing to make sure that if one of the players has faulty internet that won't connect, that game is
	handled correctly.
    - The time limit for the player runs out
    - The server tries to ping the client
      - Does not receive a pong
    - The server behaves the same way that it would in the case of disconnection, in effect:
      - The player who had faulty internet loses
      - The other player wins the game
  - One of the players enters practice mode
    - Practice mode does not connect to the server through a web socket
    - Practice mode simulates Conway's game of life
    - The player creates a glider
    - The player uses the ~Step Forward~ button to move the glider.
  - Everything is working as it should
